## **Overview**

This part of the project focuses on verifying the behavior of task suspension and resumption in FreeRTOS using CBMC. The verification ensures that tasks transition correctly between `READY`, `RUNNING`, and `SUSPENDED` states based on the corresponding API calls.

---

## **Implementation Details**

### **Key Components**

#### **1. Enhanced Task Data Structure**

- Introduced a simplified `tskTaskControlBlock` structure with:
  - A placeholder for the stack pointer (`pxStack`).
  - Task parameters (`pvParameters`).
  - Task state (`state`) represented by an enum:
    ```c
    typedef enum { TASK_READY, TASK_RUNNING, TASK_SUSPENDED } TaskState;
    ```

#### **2. Core FreeRTOS Stubs**

- **`xTaskCreate`**:
  - Simulates dynamic task creation using a static memory pool (`__CPROVER_malloc`).
  - Initializes task state to `TASK_READY`.
  - Returns `pdPASS` or `pdFAIL` based on memory availability.
- **`vTaskSuspend`**:
  - Changes the task state to `TASK_SUSPENDED`.
  - Includes assertions to validate non-NULL task handles.
- **`vTaskResume`**:

  - Changes the task state from `TASK_SUSPENDED` to `TASK_READY`.
  - Asserts the validity of task handles and ensures only suspended tasks are resumed.

- **`vTaskStartScheduler`**:
  - Models the scheduler's behavior with an infinite assumption (`__CPROVER_assume(0)`).

#### **3. Memory Allocation Simulation**

- Implemented `__CPROVER_malloc` with a static memory pool to simulate limited memory resources for task creation.

#### **4. Nondeterministic Task Behavior**

- Simulated task functions with `nondet_task_function`, which includes:
  - Infinite loops.
  - Nondeterministic behavior (`__CPROVER_nondet_bool`) to model real-world task variability.

---

### **Verification: `CBMC_VerifySuspension`**

#### **Functionality**

1. **Task Creation**:

   - Creates a task (`task1`) using `xTaskCreate`.
   - Ensures task creation succeeds with `__CPROVER_assume`.

2. **Task Suspension**:

   - Suspends the task using `vTaskSuspend`.
   - Verifies that the task's state transitions to `TASK_SUSPENDED`.

3. **Assertions**:
   - Ensures the task remains in `TASK_SUSPENDED` until explicitly resumed.
   - Validates that the task does not transition back to `READY` without a resumption API call.

---

## **Progress Summary**

### **Original State**

- Focused on basic task creation and scheduling.
- Lacked detailed modeling of task state transitions and API behavior.

### **Current Enhancements**

1. **Task State Management**:

   - Implemented `TASK_READY`, `TASK_RUNNING`, and `TASK_SUSPENDED` states.
   - Added explicit state transitions for `vTaskSuspend` and `vTaskResume`.

2. **Dynamic Memory Simulation**:

   - Used `__CPROVER_malloc` with a bounded memory pool to model FreeRTOS memory constraints.
   - Simulated out-of-memory conditions.

3. **Detailed Verification**:

   - Validated task state transitions during suspension and resumption.
   - Ensured tasks cannot transition back to `READY` without an explicit API call.

4. **Realistic Task Modeling**:
   - Included a nondeterministic task function to simulate unpredictable runtime behavior.

---

## **Key Outcomes**

1. **Verification Passed**:

   - Task state transitions (`READY` â†’ `SUSPENDED`) were correctly modeled and verified.
   - Assertions ensured tasks remained suspended until explicitly resumed.

2. **Enhanced Realism**:

   - Simulated dynamic memory allocation and finite memory constraints.
   - Introduced nondeterministic task behavior for practical testing scenarios.

3. **Modularity**:
   - Modular stubs for task creation, suspension, and resumption improve scalability for future verification tasks.

---

## **Future Work**

1. Extend verification to include:

   - Task priority management.
   - Scheduler behavior for multiple tasks.
   - Interrupt handling during task suspension.

2. Simulate task preemption and context switching for more comprehensive modeling.

3. Introduce bounded loops in the scheduler for finite state analysis.

This progress demonstrates significant advancements in modeling and verifying task suspension and resumption in FreeRTOS, paving the way for deeper verification of scheduling and task management.
