## **Overview**

This part of the project verifies that a **lower-priority task does not preempt a higher-priority task** in FreeRTOS using CBMC. The verification ensures that tasks with lower priority cannot transition to the `RUNNING` state while a higher-priority task is already running.

---

## **Implementation Details**

### **Key Components**

#### **1. Task Data Structure**

- Enhanced the `tskTaskControlBlock` structure to include:
  - A placeholder for the stack pointer (`pxStack`).
  - Task parameters (`pvParameters`).
  - Task state (`state`) represented by an enum:
    ```c
    typedef enum { TASK_READY, TASK_RUNNING, TASK_SUSPENDED } TaskState;
    ```
  - Task priority (`priority`).

#### **2. Core FreeRTOS Stubs**

- **`xTaskCreate`**:

  - Simulates task creation with dynamic memory allocation (`__CPROVER_malloc`).
  - Initializes tasks with `TASK_READY` state and assigns priorities.

- **`taskYIELD`**:

  - Simulates the scheduler's behavior:

    - The current running task yields to a task with **higher priority**.
    - A lower-priority task **cannot preempt** a running higher-priority task.

    ```c
    void taskYIELD(TaskHandle_t currentTask, TaskHandle_t nextTask) {
        __CPROVER_assert(currentTask != NULL && nextTask != NULL, "Tasks must not be NULL");
        if (nextTask->priority > currentTask->priority) {
            currentTask->state = TASK_READY;
            nextTask->state = TASK_RUNNING;
        }
    }
    ```

#### **3. Memory Allocation Simulation**

- Simulated dynamic memory allocation using a static memory pool to mimic FreeRTOS constraints.

#### **4. Verification Function: `CBMC_VerifyPreemption`**

1. **Task Creation**:

   - Created two tasks:
     - `highPriorityTask` with priority `2`.
     - `lowPriorityTask` with priority `1`.

2. **Task State Initialization**:

   - Set the high-priority task state to `TASK_RUNNING`.
   - Set the low-priority task state to `TASK_READY`.

3. **Scheduler Behavior**:

   - Simulated the scheduler using `taskYIELD`.

4. **Assertions**:
   - Verified that the high-priority task remains in `TASK_RUNNING`.
   - Ensured the low-priority task does **not** transition to `TASK_RUNNING`.

---

## **Progress Summary**

### **Original State**

- Lacked mechanisms to verify preemption based on task priorities.
- Limited scheduler behavior modeling.

### **Current Enhancements**

1. **Priority-Aware Scheduler Simulation**:

   - Added the `taskYIELD` function to simulate preemption based on task priorities.

2. **Task Priority Management**:

   - Explicitly initialized task priorities during task creation.

3. **Verification of Preemption**:

   - Ensured that the **lower-priority task** does not preempt a **higher-priority task**.

4. **Assertions for Validation**:
   - Verified task states using assertions:
     ```c
     __CPROVER_assert(highPriorityTask->state == TASK_RUNNING, "High-priority task must continue running");
     __CPROVER_assert(lowPriorityTask->state != TASK_RUNNING, "Low-priority task must not preempt the high-priority task");
     ```

---

## **Key Outcomes**

1. **Verification Passed**:

   - CBMC successfully verified that the lower-priority task does not preempt the higher-priority task.

2. **Realistic Scheduler Simulation**:

   - Simulated the behavior of a priority-aware scheduler in FreeRTOS.

3. **Improved Modularity**:
   - Reusable stubs for task creation and preemption enhance future verification tasks.

---

## **Future Work**

1. Extend verification to include:

   - Round-robin scheduling for tasks with **equal priorities**.
   - Interrupt-based task preemption.
   - Context switching scenarios with multiple tasks.

2. Model idle task behavior and verify correct preemption logic.

3. Introduce additional verification for FreeRTOS API functions like:
   - `vTaskDelay`
   - `vTaskPrioritySet`
   - `vTaskDelete`

---

This progress confirms that **task preemption in FreeRTOS respects priority-based scheduling**, ensuring correctness of the system scheduler.
